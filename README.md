# Klabautermann

Klabautermann was an impish sprite in Germanic mythology known for assisting and rescuing sailors. It represents the codename for my personal project to create a readout tool for our company support dumps.

# Prequisites
- A modern browser. Should work in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and even Microsoft Edge

# Usage
## Website
Navigate to Github page at: https://th3geekguy.github.io/klabautermann/ and upload a company support dump. All analysis is done client side using the [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) library and Javascript. No information is sent server side and cluster is not uploaded. Can be used offline if website is saved to disk.

_**TODO**_: More and better output, possibly further analysis of cluster or easier reading at a glance of structure. Also, easy copy of output as CSV, TSV, and/or fixed width
